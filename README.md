# React Facade

An experimental library that uses [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and TypeScript to create a strongly typed [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) for your React hooks.

- **Dependency inversion between components and hooks:** Build components that rely on hooks which do not have a particular implementation.
- **Works with all of your existing hooks:** Extract hooks to the top level of your program and replace them with a facade.
- **Simplified component testing:** You were already testing your hooks anyway (right?), so why test them again? Focus on rendering outcomes rather than bungling around with difficult to setup test cases.

This library effectively allows you to write components with placeholders for hooks. Their implementation is injected via React context so that they can be changed in between views or testing. It is dependency injection for hooks which does not require higher-order functions/Components.

## Example

Consider an application which describes its data-fetching layer in the UI with the following list of hooks,

```ts
function useCurrentUser(): User;
function usePostById(id: string): { loading?: boolean; error?: Error; data?: Post };
function useCreateNewPost(): (postData: PostData) => Promise<Post>;
// etc...
```

Given this interface, a developer can reliably use these hooks without knowing anything about their underlying _implementation_. That is to say: the developer _only_ cares about the _interface_. The problem, however, is that by inlining a hook as part of the React component, the _implementation_ cannot be ignored. For example, a component `UserProfile` may have the following definition,

```ts
// user-profile.ts

import React from "react";
import { userCurrentUser } from "./hooks";

export function UserProfile() {
  const user = useCurrentUser();

  // ... render user profile
}
```

The developer of this component may not care about the implementation of `useCurrentUser`, but the tests sure do! If under the hood `useCurrentUser` is calling the react-redux `useSelector`, then `UserProfile` depends directly on a global Redux store. What's more, any component using `UserProvider` also has this dependency. The coupling between the store and component tree is hard-coded by this hook. Yikes! And yet this is not an uncommon problem. ðŸ™ƒ

Now consider the same problem where the _implementation_ can be completely ignored with dependency injection in its place. We define the same interface using `createFacade`,

```ts
// facade.ts

import { createFacade } from "react-facade";

type Hooks = {
  useCurrentUser(): User;
  usePostById(id: string): { loading?: boolean; error?: Error; data?: Post };
  useCreateNewPost(): (postData: PostData) => Promise<Post>;
  // ...
};

// no implementation!
export const [hooks, ImplementationProvider] = createFacade<Hooks>();
```

And then the `UserProfile` becomes,

```ts
// user-profile.ts

import React from "react";
import { hooks } from "./facade";

export function UserProfile() {
  const user = hooks.useCurrentUser();

  // ... render user profile
}
```

This time, the developers does not care about the _implementation_ because there literally isn't one. It can be replaced depending on the environment by passing a different _implementation_ to `ImplementationProvider`.

At the application level, we might use `useSelector` to fetch the current user from our store,

```tsx
// app.tsx

import React from "react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { ImplementationProvider } from "./facade";
// ...

const implementation = {
  useCurrentUser(): User {
    return useSelector(getCurrentUser);
  },

  // ...
};

return (
  <ImplementationProvider implementation={implementation}>
    <UserProfile />
  </ImplementationProvider>
);
```

While in a test environment, we can return a stub user so long as it matches our _interface_.

```tsx
// user-profile.test.tsx

import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { ImplementationProvider } from "./facade";
// ...

test("some thing", () => {
  const implementation = {
    useCurrentUser(): User {
      return {
        id: "stub",
        name: "Gabe",
        // ...
      };
    },

    // ...
  };

  const result = render(
    // What is `__UNSAFE_Partial`? See API section
    <ImplementationProvider.__UNSAFE_Partial implementation={implementation}>
      <UserProfile />
    </ImplementationProvider.__UNSAFE_Partial>
  );

  // ...
});
```

We are programming toward the _interface_ and _NOT_ the _implementation_!

Now consider how this might simplify testing a component that relied on this hook...

```ts
function usePostById(id: string): { loading?: boolean; error?: Error; data?: Post };
```

## API

### `createFacade`

```ts
function createFacade<T>(displayName?: string): [Proxy<T>, ImplementationProvider<T>];
```

Takes a type definition `T` - which must be an object where each member is a function - and returns the tuple of the interface `T` (through a Proxy) and a Provider. The developer provides the real implementation of the interface through the `ImplementationProvider`.

The `ImplementationProvider` does not collide with other `ImplementationProvider`s, so you can make as many of these as you need.

### `ImplementationProvider<T>`

Accepts a single prop `implementation: T` that implements the interface defined in `createFacade<T>()`.

```ts
const implementation = {
  useCurrentUser(): User {
    return useSelector(getCurrentUser);
  },

  // ...
};

return (
  <ImplementationProvider implementation={implementation}>
    <UserProfile />
  </ImplementationProvider>
);
```

### `ImplementationProvider<T>.Override`

For partially overriding the implementation. You may use this when you want to inject different business logic into a hook but don't want to change the presentation. As long as the interface remains the same, the code will continue to work.

### `ImplementationProvider<T>.__UNSAFE_Partial`

For partially implementing the interface when you don't need to implement the whole thing but still want it to typecheck (tests?). For the love of God, please do not use this outside of tests...

```tsx
<ImplementationProvider.__UNSAFE_Partial implementation={partialImplementation}>
  <UserProfile />
</ImplementationProvider.__UNSAFE_Partial>
```

## Installing

```bash
npm install react-facade
```

## Asked Questions

### Why not just use `jest.mock?`

Mocking at the module level has the notable downside that type safety is optional. The onus is on the developer to make sure that the mock matches the real interface. While stubbing with a _static_ language is dangerous enough because it removes critical interactions between units of code, a _dynamic_ language is even worse because changes to the real implementation interface (without changes to the stub) can result in runtime type errors in production. Choosing to forgo the type check means that you might as well be writing JavaScript.

### Can I use this with plain JavaScript?

It's 2021, bud. Why aren't you writing TypeScript?

It is _really_ important that this library is used with TypeScript. It's kind of a trick to use a Proxy object in place of a real implementation when calling `createFacade`, so there's really nothing stopping you from calling a function that does not exist. Especially bad would be destructuring so that your fake hook could be used elsewhere in the program.

```js
// hooks.js

export const { useSomethingThatDoesNotExist } = hooks;
```

```js
// my-component.jsx

import { useSomethingThatDoesNotExist } from "./hooks";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const value = useSomethingThatDoesNotExist(); // throw new Error('oopsie-doodle!')
};
```

The only thing preventing you from cheating like this is good ol' TypeScript.

### Is this safe to use?

Popular libraries like [`immer`](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) use the same trick of wrapping data `T` in a `Proxy` and present it as `T`, so I don't think you should be concerned. At the time of writing this, Proxy has [~96% browser support](https://caniuse.com/proxy).
